What?
============
Harvest is a multithreaded C# library for web-crawling. With a lightweight and flexible architecture, it makes common crawling tasks easy.

The API is minimal, and you can control pretty much everything.

Examples
============
[Crawling a site for all external links](https://github.com/alexandernyquist/Harvest/wiki/Crawling-a-site-for-all-external-links)

Want to help?
============
Contributions are very welcome. If you think Harvest is interesting, please drop me an email, issue or pull request. Thank you!

That's it?
============
Yep, for now. Note that Harvest is pretty much a work in progress, but it's already used in production to do some cool things.
